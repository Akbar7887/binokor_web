# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Oswald
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oswald-ExtraLight.ttf
